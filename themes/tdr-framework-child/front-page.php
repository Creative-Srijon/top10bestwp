                <p>When it comes to WordPress hosting there is so much misinformation out there that even professionals don't know where to turn.  We strive to individually test every hosting service we review.  By covering topics such as speed, reliability, cost, customer service and ease-of-use we can advise you on how to make the best choice.  It is time consuming and expensive for us to do this but it lets us stand behind every review we make.</p>

                <p>We are a group of professionals that spend each and every day of our lives working with WordPress.  In doing this we were able to acquire a lot of knowledge not only about WordPress itself but also about deploying it.  The frustration of seeing the other reviews online and the terrible advice they were giving inspired us to make this site.</p>

                <p>To start with, we review the sites that we have experienced over the years.  Whether our experience with them was good or bad we strive to give clear and meaningful feedback.  As with any product, you have pros and cons. With WordPress hosting it is no different.  A lot of comparison sites we have seen over the years simply list their reviews in order of their commission.  We order ours in order of the best features and value provided.  No exceptions.
